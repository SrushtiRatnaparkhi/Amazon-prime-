This Power BI dashboard project provides a comprehensive analysis of Amazon Prime Video's content library.
The Power BI file for this project is substantial in size. To view and interact with the dashboard, you can download the raw .pbix file and open it using Power BI Desktop on your local computer. This allows for a detailed exploration of the data and visualizations provided.
By analyzing total shows by country, content type distribution, release year trends, viewer ratings, genre preferences, and temporal availability, the dashboard facilitates informed decision-making regarding content acquisition, audience targeting, and platform strategy.
